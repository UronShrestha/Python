# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times. 
#             you can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

#e.g 1: count 1 to 10
print("Counting forward from 1 to 10:")
for x in range(1,11):
    print(x)
print("")

#e.g 2: count 10 to 1 in reverse
print("Counting reverse from 1 to 10:")
for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
    print(x)
print("")
